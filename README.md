Python Developer specializing in data engineering, applied AI, cloud security, and quantitative finance. I design and build scalable systems for market data ingestion, backtesting, and machine learning–driven trading signal generation.

My recent research applies artificial intelligence to predict the yield of physics experiments involving compounds such as copper sulfate, optimizing accuracy and reducing trial cycles. This work bridges data science and physical experimentation, showcasing my ability to apply AI across domains.

I also have a strong background in cybersecurity and penetration testing, demonstrated by placing 2nd in a CIA-sponsored national cybersecurity hackathon hosted at Southern University, bringing a unique blend of finance, scientific research, and security expertise.

B.S. in Computer Science, Concentration in Information Systems (Expected December 2025)
